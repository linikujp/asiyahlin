The [NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability Effort (NCPI)](https://anvilproject.org/ncpi) is a grass shooting effort to establish the federated genomic data ecosystem on heterogeneous cloud platforms â€“ [Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/), [BioData Catalyst (BDC)](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/), [NHGRI Analysis Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL)](https://anvilproject.org/), [Kids First Data Portal](https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/login) and [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/) - funded by National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), and NIH Common Fund. The goal of the NCPI is to establish and implement guidelines and technical standards to empower end-user analyses across participating cloud platforms and facilitate the realization of a trans-NIH, federated data ecosystem. The NCPI is a complex federal government project involving cross-functional internal and external senior stakeholders that requires both technical and administrative support. <br/><br/>

**My Role**: to provide technical, administrative, and coordination support the NCPI project:  

* Oversees the NCPI program, facilitating and coordinating the Other Transaction Award to NCPI Administrative Coordination Center including Funding Opportunity Award drafting, reviewing, budgeting plan, setting objectives and milestones, working with ODSS and the Other Transaction specialist to negotiate the prospective awardees.
* With senior managers, establish strategic long term and short-term planning for driven use cases, community based outreach, partnership development (NIH internal and external), funding mechanism, evaluation, and sustainability for NCPI.
* Provide administrative support and project management to ensure the milestones, goals and deadlines of various tasks being met within current NCPI working groups.
* Develop agile, nimble and lean working processes and structures to achieve efficiency.
* Build relationships and establish communications across multiple NIH institutes, NIH-external awardees as well as prospective cloud platform interoperability stakeholders. 
* Establish and oversee all working groups. Initiated the Search WG to focus on search strategies across cloud platforms.
* Facilitate the NCPI internal discuss with Office of Science Policy on Developer Access for data across platforms.
* Evaluate and recommend ontologies use to support portal UI/UX development. 
*	Evaluate and establish FHIR interoperability with biomedical knowledge graph modeling tool (LinkML)
*	Identify, evaluate, and recommend tools, ontologies, and data modeling harmonization methods to increase access to and utility of clinical, biological, and other scientific datasets and knowledge bases.
*	Actively reach out to NCPI potential partners, such as All of Us, GA4GH, Elixir, to establish the path forward to expand NCPI efforts.
