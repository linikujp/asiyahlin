**Dr. Asiyah Yu Lin** is a senior data scientist consultant and a seasoned ontologist trained in immunology, pediatrics, and informatics. Her career spans a range of medical research and technical roles at academic institutions, private start-ups, and in government across China, Japan and the US. She has applied ontologies in a wide variety areas, including data management, knowledge management, artificial intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML), strategic design, business analysis, process development, and project control and coordination in the medicinal product regulation and biomedical research space. Dr. Lin advocates leveraging ontologies for data integrity, interoperability, standardization, and establishing a knowledge eco-system for science and regulatory communities.

* Dr. Lin joined NIH in December 2020 as a DATA scholar with the NIHâ€™s Data and Technology Advancement National Service Scholar program at the Nathional Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). In this role, Dr. Lin coordinates NIH internal and external stakeholders for the [NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI)](https://anvilproject.org/ncpi) to enable researchers to find, access, and analyze genomics and clinical data across multiple NIH supported genomics data ecosystems. The NCPI is a complex federal government project involving cross-functional internal and external senior stakeholders that requires both technical and administrative support. Dr. Lin successfully supported the creation and execution of the recent Other Transaction (OT) award of the Administrative Coordination Center for the NCPI.  

* Prior to NIH, Dr. Lin worked on various informatics and ontology projects to accelerate regulatory science for Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) at the FDA since 2015. Besides regulatory post-market surveillance and pre-market submission review, Dr. Lin co-leads multiple working groups in various Private-Publish Partnerships (e.g. [MDEpiNet](https://www.mdepinet.net/) and [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/)) to support the informatics, Common Data Models (CDM), and standards for Real World Data/Evidence (RWD/RWE) use in regulatory decision making for medical devices and vaccines. 

* Dr. Lin is an influential young leader in the biomedical ontology community. Recently, she started to focus on ontology harmonization and FAIR ontology to improve the use of ontologies in business processes. She initiated and leads the global effort of COVID-19 ontology harmonization to improve the interoperability of the global COVID data. Dr. Lin actively engages her fellow ontologists to establish international and national collaborations, and to organize the annual International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO). She loves the art of ontology design and keeps developing them as a hobby. She involves in many ontology development efforts, including Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology(CIDO), Clinical Trial Ontology (CTO), Informed Consent Ontology (ICO), Vaccine Ontology (VO),  Drug Target Ontology (DTO), Brucelosis Ontology (IDOBRU), Ontology for Biomedical Investigation (OBI) and more.

* Dr. Lin leads an FDA/NIH led multi-agency Ontology Round Table Discussion Group to bring industries and academic ontology implementation experience at the enterprise level to her government colleagues. In her spare time, Dr. Lin and her fellow ontologists maintain a YouTube channel - [Biomedical Ontology World](https://www.youtube.com/@biomedicalontologyworld) - dedicated to educate biomedical ontologies to non-ontologist end users around the world. Dr. Lin also dedicates her time to nurture youth for biomedical informatics and data science via her personally founded volunteer group, the [Biomedical Informatics Research and Data Science for Youth](http://biomedicalinformatics4youth.org/).
